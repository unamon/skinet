# Skinet 

## Description
This is a demonstration of an online store with a .NET backend. It was created as a practice project, and in order to learn the technology stack involved. 
It was largely made following [Neil Cumming's Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-to-build-an-e-commerce-app-with-net-core-and-angular/), but other features are planned to expand it. 

# Stack 
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) as a front-end framework. 
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and responsivity. 
- [.NET 7](dotnet.microsoft.com/) as the back-end API.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the main DB. 
- [Redis](https://redis.io/) as an in-memory database for basket persistency. 
- [Stripe](stripe.com/) for payments.
